# Overview

This is an attempt to translate MIT's Computer Science curricula into human-readable format, so I can follow along via Open Courseware without stabbing myself in the face.

There are two [undergraduate degrees](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/curriculum2017) which intrigue me: 6-3: Computer Science and Engineering, and 6-14: Computer Science, Economics and Data Science. I got halfway through translating the 6-14 degree and decided it wasn't for me, though.

To anyone attempting to do the same: [this](https://everything2.com/title/MIT+Course+Numbers) was a mildly useful aid in this task.
